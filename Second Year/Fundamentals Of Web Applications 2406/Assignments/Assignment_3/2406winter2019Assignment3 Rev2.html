<p class="red">Assignment
Revisions and Corrections will be noted here.
</p>
<p class="red">Rev 2: Clarification of R3.3, 3.7: Spectators should be able to join a game already in progress.</p>
<p class="red">Rev 1: This assignment is described from the perspective that you will be using specifically the socket.io npm web sockets module. But if you prefer you can use one of the other npm web socket implementations, like ws, or whatever. (If you find another one you like email me the details about it.)</p>
<hr>
<h2>Node.js/Javascript Collaborative App</h2>
<p>With this assignment we introduce some new web app elements.</p>
<p>1) We break away from the strict HTTP request-response model and allow asynchronous communication between client and server using web sockets. This means that the server can send data to a client that is not in direct response to a request from that client. This makes real-time collaboration (like chat rooms and online games) possible.</p>
<p>2) We introduce the use of an external NPM module <span class="bold">socket.io</span> to provide web socket capabilities.  This allows  asynchronous communication between client and servers using the world wide web's HTTP protocol. </p>
<p>3) We introduce the design problem of &quot;who is in charge of the data and decision making&quot;. It could be the server, a client, several clients, different clients taking turns. There is no right answer so you will have to make design choices. This is an ongoing design dilemma that you will always face when building web apps especially ones that involve collaboration among the clients.</p>
<p>In this assignment you will build a real-time collaborative app based on web sockets. Since this is meant to be an app that allows people working in different browsers to collaborate you can take advantage of the fact that we can host servers on the OpenStack virtual machines that can be reached by several different machines. If you run your server on an openstack machine with a floating IP address allocated others will be able to reach it from their own machines.</p>
<p>In this assignment you are going build a single page client-server app based primarily on native capabilties of Node.js, however this time you will use the npm module <span class="bold">socket.io</span> to implement asynchronous real-time data exchange between client and server. You are also free to import (or more correctly &quot;require&quot;) other simple npm modules from the npm (node package manager) registry. However, the use of Express.js and similar &quot;high level&quot; frameworks is still not allowed for this assignment. This is still primarily a javascript programming exercise and we still want you to build an app based primarily on node.js built in capabilities with a few helper modules.</p>
<p>The components are:</p>
<p >Server build with just Node.js and its build in modules (e.g. http, path, fs, url), and that makes use of the npm socket.io module. You <span class="bold">MAY NOT</span> use express.js. If you have any doubts about whether you can require a certain npm module please check with me ahead of time.</p>
<p >Client: browser that is provided with a web page from the server consisting of html, css, javascript and jquery. (You can use which ever of these your want.) Once the initial webpage is served the remaining exchange between client and server will be in the form of JSON data strings.</p>

<h2>Submission and Good Programming Practice Requirements</h2>
<p>The following requirements pertain to all 
  your assignments regardless of what your application is supposed to do (i.e. 
  regardless of the design requirements). These requirements are to ensure that 
  your code is usable, readable, and maintainable.</p>

  exception: It's OK to call simple for-loop counters i,j and k etc. when the 
  context is clear and VERY localized.) Javascript variables don't have types which can help clarify things so choosing good names is even more important. Many functions in javascript are annonymous (have no name) and so the name of the variable that refers to them is even more important.</p>

  must coincide with what the code actually does. It is a very common bug to modify or cut-and-paste code and forget to modify the comments and so you 
  end up with comments that say one thing and code that actually does another. Don't over-comment your code - instead choose good variable names 
  and function names that make the code  &quot;self commenting&quot;. Don't be reluctant to create local variables  so that the variable name provides more clarity -there is no prize for having the fewest lines of code. <span class="font-weight-bold"><span class="red">[Minus 2 marks from assignment if this requirement is not met.]</span></span></p>

<h1>Application Requirements</h1>
<p><span class="text-danger"><span class="badge badge-danger"><span class="requirement_danger">R0.4</span></span> <span class="red">INTENT REQUIREMENT: This assignment will be evaluated by you hosting your game on your Openstack server and demonstrating your solution in your tutorial session on the week the assignment is due. All assignments code is due before the start of the first tutorial that week. You will need to demonstrate that one of clients of your game is on another machine and the clients are co-ordinating through your openstack-hosted server. The evaluating TA's might use a mobile device as one of the clients as well.</span></span></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>For this assignment you will build a small app that features  real-time collaboration between, or among, more than one browser client at the same time -ideally running on different machines. You will build a simple multi-player interpretation of a curling game based on an existing single-client demo version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/curling.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Real-time collaboration using web sockets is illustrated in  tutorial 05   and you should  work on tutorial 05 before you start coding this assignment -though you can think about the design beforehand. You can use that code if you want or abandon it completely -this assigment can be started from a &quot;clean slate&quot;. The main design challenges will be to decide what gets communicated between client and server and who decides things like where   the curling stones are, how they move, where and when collisions take place, and how stones deflect as a result of the collisions.</p>
<p>For this application two users with separate browsers are players but other browsers can be spectators viewing the game being played. So there will generally be more than two browsers involved. The two players would each have control of one colour of curling stone (the home team and the visitor team). A player will shoot the stone with their mouse as described in the requirements below and the motion and collisions of the stones will appear synchronized in all the clients.</p>
<p class="red">Demo Code: We have provided a single-client simulation of the curling game. Your goal will be to turn this into a multi-player online game. You will have to make all the design decisions about what data is stored on the server and how data is exchanged with the clients. You are free to use as much of the demo code as you want or abandon it alltogether.</p>
<p class="red">The demo code contains a user text field, submit button and moving word. Those might not needed in the assignment and could be removed -they are just there as programming examples incase you need to make use of that capability. The moving string, for example, illustrates how the length of the rendered string can be measured.</p>
<p class="red">We have also be posting an example of a polling-based collaborative app (Asynchronous Collaboration based on Polling) and examples based on sockets (Basic Chat Collaboration with WebSockets) in the course notes module 13 on Real-Time Collaboration. Asynchronous interaction using web sockets is also explored in tutorial 05.</p>
<p class="red">To play the demo application you need to first register as both the home and visitor player by pressing the provided buttons. After which you you can shoot from the shooting area for those players. The colour of the box around the score shows whether you are registered. The colour of the shooting area box shows which player should shoot next. The following screen capture video illustrates the demo code.</p>

 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <h2>1) Server-Side Requirements</h2>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R1.1</span></span> The server code should use only javascript and node.js and use  the npm <span class="bold">socket.io</span> module. Other simple modules could be allowed but discuss your intended use of them with the professor ahead of time. You <span class="bold">cannot</span> use framework modules like express.js or front-end frameworks.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R1.2</span></span> The real-time collaboration between client and server should be based on web sockets and in particular use the npm <span class="bold">socket.io</span> module.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R1.3</span></span> The server-side  javascript should keep track of, or manage, who has permission to control (or shoot) a stone and not allow players to shoot out of turn or allow spectators to shoot the stones. Other browers should only be allowed to spectate and see the game happening in real-time. Note this app can be done entirely in the main memory of the server. This assignment does not require that you read and write any files (except the static files that  deliver the app's webpage) or use a database.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R1.4</span></span> Server should be hosted on port 3000. The initial launch of the web app should be the result of the client making a request to <span class="code">http://localhost:3000/curling.html.</span></p>
<p>If on the otherhand you are hosting your server on one of our openstack machines then you will access it using an actual IP address instead of localhost using a URL like the following:<br>
  <span class="code">http://134.117.217.107:3000/curling.html </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2) Client-Server Data Exchange</h2>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R2.1</span></span> The data exchanged during the game between clients and server should be in the form of JSON object strings. The initial launch of the client web page will just be the result of a GET request for a static application .html file and other supporting files after that it should be JSON data exchange. In other words this is a single-page app from any client's perspective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3) Client Requirements</h2>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R3.1</span></span> Launch: When the app first launches the client should see the game layout of the app. It should look something like the following (based on the demo code) but you can make minor changes if you want. The changes you make, however, should still allow someone familiar with the demo code to &quot;drive&quot; your app. [You should remove the text-field, submit button, and moving word from the demo code though.] </p>
<p><img src="images/gameboard.png"  alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="requirement">R3.2</span> Player registration: When the game launches the appearance of the <span class="bold">Join as HOME</span>, <span class="bold">Join as VISITOR</span>, and <span class="bold">Join as Spectator</span>, buttons should indicate whether those are available to the client. If another client is  already registed as the HOME player, for example, then the <span class="bold">Join as HOME</span> button should be disabled. When a player joins the game the status of the buttons should change accordingly on all clients who have joined as players or spectators. </p>
<p>There are no synchornization requirements on clients who have not joined. In other words, synchronization is only required once a client actually joins as either a player or a spectator.</p>
<p><span class="requirement">R3.3</span> Player registration: Only one client should be allowed to join as the HOME player and one as the VISITOR player. But, to allow easy testing for example, a single client should be allowed to join as both the HOME and VISITOR player. Once a client has joined as a player the scoreboard part of the application should indicate that that client is a player. In the demo code, for example, a coloured box around the score indicates the client is the player. [Rev 2: Spectators should be able to join a game already in progress.]</p>
<p>[Optionally, if you want, you can have the joining players supply their name or userid and display that on all the clients as well. You could use the text-field cointained in the demo code for that if you choose to implement this.]</p>
<p><img src="images/player_indicator.png" width="689" height="240" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="requirement">R3.4</span> Shooting: A client should not  be able to shoot, or move, the stones  unless they are the registered (joined) player. Clients who join as a spectator should not be allowed to shoot or control the game in any way.</p>
<p><span class="requirement">R3.5</span> Shooting: A player client should not be allowed to shoot out of turn. Moreover the application should indicate whose turn it is to shoot next. Like in the demo code, a coloured box should be drawn in the shooting area to indicate who should shoot next. Also, like the demo code,  shooting should be disabled while stones are in motion and  not allow the next player to shoot until the stones come to rest. The &quot;next turn&quot; coloured box should appear on all clients who have joined either as players or spectators.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R3.6</span></span> Shooting: Players should shoot the stones &quot;catapult style&quot; as is done in the demo code. Players shoot from the designated shooting area indicated by the coloured box. When the mouse is pressed in the shooting area by the player whose turn it is to shoot their stone should get positioned at the mouse press location [already done in the demo code]. Shooting should appear synchronized in all registered clients and the spectators should be able to see the aiming of the shooting catapult.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R3.7</span></span> Synchronized motion: The app should show any motion and collisions of the stones on all registered browser clients and the views should be synchronized. The motion should look the same on all the browsers watching. [Rev 2: spectators should be able to join games already in progress.]</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R3.8</span></span> Close Up View: When the stones get close to the curling circles they should show up in the close up view on all the browsers watching. This should appear synchronized on all registered clients.  </p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R3.9</span></span> Collisions: The stones should move and collide with each other in a realistic, or at least pleasing, way. The motion and collisions should appear synchronized in all the browsers watching. You will have to decide where collision decisions are made (server, one browser, two browsers, browsers taking turns, etc.) and what motion data is sent between clients and server.  You should be mindful of what data is being passed back and forth. If you intend to pass your whole representation of the world around whenever anything happens that will generate a lot of network traffic. On the other hand, passing around only what is needed might smooth things  out a lot. This is obvioulsy a critical design decision in designing real-time collaboration apps.</p>
  <p>At the end of this assignment is an explanation of how the collision math in the demo code was programmed.</p>
  <p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R3.10</span></span> Hammer Time: In the demo code the colour that shoots first just alternates after each end (round). But in curling the team that earns a point in the previous round shoots first in the next round. This gives the team that did not score in the previous round <span class="bold">the hamme</span>r, or the last shot. Your application should do this by ensuring the team (home or visitor) that scores and end must shoot first in the next end.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R3.11</span></span> Deregistration: A client should be able to deregister, or un-join, the game by either closing their browser, or browser tab, or by reloading the page. The effect of one of these actions should be to send a socket message to the server that will de-register the client. When this happens the status should be reflected in all the other registered clients. For example, if the HOME player leaves then the <span class="bold">Join as HOME</span> button on all the other clients should become enabled allowing one of them to join as a player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr width="100%">
<h2>Help with Collision Math</h2>
<p><span class="badge badge-success">Here is an explanation of how the collision math in the demo code was programmed. It is already done -you don't have to implement this but  explanation might be helpful in understanding the demo code. It is based on  high-school geomery only and not physics. It is not physics because there are no forces, mass, or acceleration in the model. (If there is no force then there is no physics.) </span></p>
<h2>Mathematics of Collisions</h2>
<p>Below are two balls, weights, or curling stones (of equal mass), hitting each other. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/situation1.GIF" style="width: 720px; height: 540px;"></p>
<p>
  In the simple situation above the red weight is
    stationary and
    the yellow weight hits it. When two weights collide, the line through
    their
    centers is called the "line of impact". (Two weights collide when their
    centers
    are two weight radius lengths from each other). Suppose the yellow
    weight is traveling with velocity Vy at an angle "a" with the line of
    impact.
    After collision, the red weight will travel along the line of impact
    with
    a velocity approximately Ur = Vy*cos(a). The yellow weight will travel away with the
    same
    angle "a" but on the opposite side of the line of impact, with a
    velocity
    of approximately Vy*sin(a). In the next situation both weights
    are
    moving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/situation2.GIF" style="width: 720px; height: 540px;"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If both weights are moving the situation is similar but
  each imparts some velocity to the other. For example suppose the yellow
  weight is traveling with velocity Vy at an angle "a" with the impact
  line
  and the red weight is traveling with velocity Vr at an angle of "b"
  with
  the impact line. The yellow weight will bounce off again at an angle
  "a"
  with the impact line, but with approximate velocity Uy = Vy*sin(a) + Vr*cos(b). The
  red weight will bounce off at angle "b" with approximate velocity Ur = Vr*sin(b) +
  Vy*cos(a).</p>
<p>When programming simulations like this the 
  velocity of the weights or balls is typically stored in a vertical and horizontal component. That is, the
  vertical direction velocity is stored separately from the velocity in the
  horizontal
  direction. This makes it easy do to the animation, and is explained further below.</p>

The demo code  is based
on this analysis and works as follows: For each animation timer event, see which weights are moving and
move them. Next see if any weights have collided.
If so, adjust their velocities accordingly. In the demo code the stones maintain a boolean to indicate whether they are in motion or not -just to make checking easier.</p>
	<p>Simulations like this typically have to be debounced and the tunneling problem has to be accounted for. <span class="bold">Debouncing</span> refers to making sure the same event is not processed, and reacted to, more than once. <span class="bold">Tunneling</span> refers to be fact that when stones collide they will actually be overlapping. If they bounce off each other but don't clear the overlap before the next animation timer event they will still be overlapping (i.e. will have tunnelled into each other). These problems are handled in the demo code by making collisions objects (instances of class <span class="code">Collision</span>) and placing collisions in a collision set (instance of <span class="code">CollisionSet</span>) which prevents a collision from being processed more than once.</p>

	<h2>Hints with the Math</h2>
	<p>
Here is a further  explanation of the math
for collisions when the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity are stored separately. This is how the collisions are modelled in the demo code.</p>
<p>Lets examine the simple situation where weight 1 is
  moving
  and hits a stationary weight 2. <br>
  <br>
  At the point of collision what do we know? We know the positions of each weight, (x1,y1) and
  (x2,y2).
  We know horizontal and vertical velocity of each weight, v1x,
  v1y,&nbsp;
  v2x = 0, v2y = 0. We know the weight's centers are 2R apart (R is the
  radius
  of a weight). <br>
  The velocity vector of weight1, called V, has magnitude
  sqrt(v1x*v1x + v1y*v1y); Weight2 is stopped so its velocity is 0. </p>
<p>Our objective is to figure out the new vx and vy for
  the
  two weights after the collision. Looking at the situation 1 picture
  above
  we know the moving weight will depart at the same angle to the line of
  impact
  as it arrived -but on the opposite side, and we know the struck weight
  will
  depart along the line of impact. So everything we know at the point of
  collision is shown on the picture below. </p>

  First off, realize that the the model we are using
    is a very simple (first order) approximation. That is, you will notice
    V1
    = V*sin(a) and V2 = V*cos(a). This is not strictly accurate. It is
    based
    on the approximation that sin(a) + cos(a) ~= 1. The approximation has it
    maximum error at a=45 degrees. A better approximation would be use the more
    correct
    formula sin<sup>2</sup>(a) + cos<sup>2</sup>(a) = 1. If you want to use the
    more
    accurate interpretation for your code that is fine. In that case the
    speeds
    should be V1=V*sin<sup>2</sup>(a); V2=V*cos<sup>2</sup>(a). I will continue
    though
    with the simpler model as it would probably suffice for this level of animation. Online games often use simplified models of simplied computations to help with real-demands. </p>
<p>Now our objective is to figure out the new v1x, v1y,
  v2x,
  and v2y. Thus we want to resolve all the angles relative to vertical
  and
  horizontal. <br>
  The picture below now shows the important angles and
how they can be found.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/math2.GIF" style="width: 720px; height: 540px;"></p>
<p>Angle a is the angle the moving weight velocity
  makes with
  the line of impact. <br>
  Angle b is the angle that the line of impact makes with
  the horizontal. <br>
  The angle then that the moving weight would depart
  would
  be angle c=b-a. </p>
<p>First remember the old velocity <br>
  V = sqrt(v1x*v1x + v1y*v1y); </p>
<p>Here is how the angles can be found. </p>
<p>b = arcsin((y2-y1)/2R)&nbsp;&nbsp; //i.e. computed
  from
  the known positions of the stones. 
  //In Java, <tt>Math</tt> class there is an <tt>asin()</tt> method that
  does
  this 
  //there also the <tt>sin()</tt> and <tt>cos()</tt> methods. (Javascript has similar math functions available through the <span class="code">Math</span> function object).</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">d = arcsin(vx/V);
  //moving weight's
  angle with the vertical  </p>
<p>a = pi/2 - b <font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"
 color="#ff0000">-d </font>//i.e. angle
  a is 90 degrees less angle b and d; remember we have to work in radians
  so 90 degrees is pi/2.</p>
<p>So then the angle c at which the moving weight
  departs at relative
  to the horizon is:&nbsp; c = b - a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
<p>So now we know all the important angles so let's
  calculate
  the new speeds. </p>
<p>The new speeds are:<br>
  V1 = V*sin(a); V2 = V*cos(a);  </p>
<p>Resolve the speeds back into vertical and horizontal
  components for the two weights. </p>
<p>v1x = V1*cos(c); v1y = V1*sin(c); v2x = V2*cos(b);
  v2y
  = V2*sin(b);  </p>
<p>So now the weights are on their way with new speeds and
directions and will move when the next timer event occurs. </p>
<p>There are
  other details you may have to resolve. To handle two weights moving at
  once
  you can work out the additional details. It will involve a few more
  angles
  and speeds but won't be much harder. The other way you could do two
  weights moving is to handle it as two cases. In each case one is
  stopped and
  the
  other moving. Then just add the horizontal and vertical velocities of
  the
  two cases together at the end and you will have your answer (this is
  how the demonstration code  works).</p>
