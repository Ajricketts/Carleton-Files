/* Example of javascript eval function

In javascript functions are first order objects -they
can be treated as data objects.

Code can also be treated as data.
The eval() function will evaluate a string as
though it is source code.
It will compile and run the code.

You can ask a function for its source code by asking for its toString()

Thus we can "hack" the source-code of any function and then run that code -Yikes!
