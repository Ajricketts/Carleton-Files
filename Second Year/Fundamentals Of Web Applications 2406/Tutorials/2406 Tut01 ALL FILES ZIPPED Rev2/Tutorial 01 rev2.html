<p class="segment-header">Description:</p>
<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to get you started working with node.js and javascript. Basically to ensure you are able to launch node.js and do some simple investigation of javascript server code and learn some basics of html and css.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: To do this tutorial you must first have set up your machine by installing node.js and npm. The lecture notes <span class="black-bold">00 Installing Node and NPM</span> section of the course website has some screen capture install instructions for Windows 10, Mac OS and Linux. Nodejs is obtained from the node.js site: <a href="https://nodejs.org">https://nodejs.org</a> . </p>
<p>The course notes section also contains some startup instructions for using the VirtualBox images or the Open Stack Lubuntu image that have node and npm pre-installed as well. If you are using Mac you will have had to set up your machine as well. </p>
<p>The easiest place to start is just to install node.js natively on your machine or use the Windows machines in the computer lab which also has node installed. Once you get comfortable you can try the virtual linux images.</p>
<p>The tutorial and code files are available on the course website and there should also be a <span class="code">ALL FILES ZIPPED.zip</span> with all the files so you can download them all at once.</p>
<p>As background for this tutorial go through some of the basics of javascript and in particular javascript strings at: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/">https://www.w3schools.com/js/</a></p>
<p><span class="red">Important: tutorials are meant to be started as homework. You will not generally be able to finish a tutorial if you only start it at the tutorial session.</span></p>

<p class="segment-header">Instructions:</p>
<p class="segment-header black-bold">Overview</p>
<p>In this tutorial you will run the &quot;Hello World&quot; demo on your own machine, or the lab machine. To do these exercises you need to open a CMD terminal window on the directory where the code is that you want to execute.</p>
<p>If you have installed node.js using the &quot;install button&quot; from the node.js web site (i.e. did an actual install) you should be able to launch node from any directory -if not your PATH environment variable is not set up to find you nodejs installation.</p>
<p>For Linux users:</p>
<p>On the linux virtual image, e.g. COMP2406-F18.ova, nodejs should be installed already so you just need to open a terminal window.</p>
<p>The rest of this tutorial, and screen captures, will describe things from the Windows experience with some screen captures from the Linux image (Mac OS should be similar). </p>
<p>To confirm the install open a command terminal and execute<br />
  <span class="code">&gt;node -v</span></p>
<p>You should get the version number as a response (see screen capture below).</p>
<p>To confirm npm (node package manager) is installed execute<br />
<span class="code">&gt;npm -v</span></p>
<p>Finally to enter the node REPL loop (read, evaluate, print, loop) execute</p>
<p class="code">&gt;node</p>
<p>then try</p>
<p class="code">&gt;1+2;</p>
<p>and your should see the result<br />
  <span class="code">3</span></p>
<p>To get out of the REPL loop execute<br />
<span class="code">&gt;.exit</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here on the 2017 linux image <span class="red">(winter 2019 will likely be v10.x.x node and v6.x.x npm)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="images/01version.png" width="891" height="187" alt=""></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="segment-header">Problem 1)</p>
<p>Download the file in the tutotial 01 <span class="code">demo_code</span> folder called <span class="code">server.js</span> and place it in a convenient directory. Open a CMD terminal to the same directory.</p>
<p>In the CMD window execute: <span class="code">node server.js</span> You should now have a simple server running listening for client HTTP requests coming to port 3000. (You can stop the server by typing CNTL-C.)</p>
<p><img src="images/problem1-1.png"  alt="p1-1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open a web browser, like Chrome, Firefox, IE, or Safari, and go to the url address: <span class="code">http://localhost:3000/index.html</span> or alternatively <span class="code">http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html</span> (This is the loopback address by which you can talk to yourself over the internet. <span class="code">localhost</span> always maps to IP address 127.0.0.1) The screen captures are for the Chrome browser and the rest of the tutorial, and course, will discuss things from the point of view of the Chrome  (the world's most popular browser).<br />
</p>
<p>Your browser should show:</p>
<p><img src="images/problem1-2.png" alt="p1-2" width="720" height="317" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You now have a simple HTTP server running. Hit the page refresh a few times on your browser. See what happens to the visitor counter being output. (It might, or might not, appear to increment the visitor counter by 2 each time you refresh.)</p>
<p>You can quit the server, by typing CNTL-C in the command terminal you used to launch it.<br />
</p>
<p>Open the <span class="code">server.js</span>  file in your favourite text editor. The code should look something like:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Study this code and start to get familiar with this simple server. You are not expected to understand it all at this point -just get to know the style of the code. (especially notice the nested declaration of a function with no apparent name, and lots of nested levels of brackets.) Also start noticing that javascript has three styles of string literals: 'Lou', &quot;Lou&quot;, and `Lou` -and people mix and match them everywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="segment-header">Problem 2)</p>
<p>Next lets look at the network traffic between the browser and the server. We will describe this from the perspective of the Chrome browser (or Chromium on linux). (You will have to do some research to see how to locate the developer tools for other browsers if you don't want to use Chrome.)</p>
<p>Shut down the server (CNTL-C) and restart it to reset the counter.</p>
<p>This time open the Chrome browser but before you visit the page open its developer tools as follows. (<span class="black-bold">Menu icon/More Tools/Developer Tools</span>)</p>
<p><img src="images/problem2-1.png" width="730" height="615" alt="p2-1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on the <span class="black-bold">Network</span> tab to so it will show HTTP messages between the browser and the server.</p>
<p><img src="images/problem2-2.png" width="1131" height="291" alt="p2-2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now with the developer tool open visit <span class="code">http://localhost:3000/index.html</span>  and you should see the traffic between the browser and server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/problem2-3.png"  alt="p2-3" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on the message marked &quot;index.html&quot; and it should open a details window as shown below (look in the Headers tab).</p>
<p><img src="images/problem2-4.png" alt="p2-4"/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this details window locate the following bits of information:</p>
<p>The URL being visited. </p>
<p>The HTTP request method (e.g. GET, POST, ...).</p>
<p>The status code of 200 back to the browser indicating success.</p>
<p>The MIME Content-Type of the response data. </p>
<p>Being able to find this information is going to be essential for debugging client server code in this course. Look at some of the other information that is part of this message. The Request Headers are information that comes from the browser as part of the HTTP request to the server and the Response Headers are part of the information that is sent back to the browser from the server in the HTTP response from the server.</p>
<h2>Before we continue:</h2>
<p class="segment-header"><span class="black-bold"><span class="red">IMPORTANT ERROR MESSAGE</span></span></p>
<p>It will likey happen to you in the course that you try to start a server with, say, <span class="code">node server.js</span> and get the following <span class="black-bold">EADDRINUSE :::3000</span> error message. It means you already have a server running on the same port (3000). Find it and shut it down. Likely it's represented by another terminal window on your machine.</p>
<p><img src="images/error_message.png" width="970" height="518" alt=""/></p>
<p class="segment-header">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="segment-header">Problem 3)</p>
<p>The request and response mentioned in the previous question are in fact represented by the <span class="code">request</span> and <span class="code">response</span> arguments in the <span class="code">createServer(function(request,response){...})</span> callback function. It is called a &quot;callback&quot; function because it will be &quot;called back&quot; when a HTTP request comes in. The callback function examines the <span class="code">request</span> object to see what the client wants and builds up the <span class="code">response</span> object to represent the response that will be sent back  by the server. Once the response is completed it is ended with <span class="code">response.end()</span> which results in an HTTP response message being sent back to the  client.</p>
<p>We are interested in actually getting access to some of this information in the <span class="code">request</span> object within our server javascript. That is, we want to extract information from the request object that arrived with the HTTP request.</p>
<p>Javascript objects are just collections of key-value pairs. You can examine javascript objects by printing the key-value pair contents. Lets do that with the request object to extract information about what the client might want.</p>
<p>Add the following code to the server javascript (just before <span class="code">visitorCounter++</span> statement) and then restart the server.</p>
<pre>
      console.log('request:' + request)
      console.log('\nREQUEST OBJECT KEYS (own property):')
      for(k in request) if(request.hasOwnProperty(k)) console.log('key: ' + k)

</pre>

<p>This time when we run the server we should see output on the server console like the following.</p>
<p><img src="images/problem3-1.png"  alt="p3-1"/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to see what type of data is associated with each key use the following code instead:</p>
<pre>
      console.log('request:' + request)
      console.log('\nREQUEST OBJECT KEYS (own property):')
      for(k in request)
         if(request.hasOwnProperty(k)) console.log('key: ' + k + ' typeof: ' + typeof request[k])
</pre>
<p>All objects in javascript are collections of key:value pairs. Here we are seeing all the keys of the request object. Keys are just javascript strings but the values can be any javascript type. Examining the <span class="code">request</span> and <span class="code">response</span> object's contents will be essential for debugging code in this course.</p>
<p>Notice among this output we appear to be intercepting the URL of the resource the client is requesting and the HTTP <span class="black-bold">method</span>. Lets look at their values to see if they match what we saw in the browser.</p>
<p>Modify the code to only show those fields, So now our code would look like:</p>
<pre>
      console.log("url: " + request.url)
      console.log("method: " + request.method)

</pre>
<p>and the corresponding output when visiting <span class="code">http://localhost:3000/index.html</span> would look like:</p>
<p><img src="images/problem3-2.png"  alt="p3-2"/></p>
<p>Now try visiting <span class="code">http://localhost:3000/</span></p>
<p>The output should  now show:</p>
<p><img src="images/problem3-3.png" alt="p3-3"/></p>
<p>Finally try visiting <span class="code">http://localhost:3000/index.html?name=Louis</span> and the output should be</p>
<p><img src="images/problem3-4.png" alt="p3-4" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we are able to intercept with our server's javascript the resource the client wants including the <span class="black-bold">query string</span> portion (the part after the &quot;?&quot;). </p>
<p>It's also very useful to see the keys and values of the request object's <span class="code">headers</span>.</p>
<p>Try adding the following code and see what you get. What do you suppose this type of information from the client message might represent (yours will look similar but not exactly the same as below)?</p>
<pre>
console.log("request headers:")
console.log(request.headers)
</pre>
<p><img src="images/problem3-4B.png" alt=""></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="segment-header">Problem 4)</p>
<p>For the next problem we want to add some <span class="black-bold">css</span> styling to our index.html webpage. To see how basic css styling works visit the w3schools css tutorial site: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">https://www.w3schools.com/css/</a>.</p>
<p>Add some css styling by adding &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; tags in the&lt;head&gt; section of the the html that the server and sends back to the client. For example, style the index page to look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/problem4-1.png" width="540" height="287" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="segment-header">Problem 5)</p>
<p>Create a new <span class="black-bold">route</span> (that is, an if-statement section) in the server that provides a <span class="code">/login.html</span> option that will serve an HTML page with a <span class="black-bold">form</span> to the client. To learn more about html forms visit: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp</a></p>
<p>Make the &quot;action&quot; attribute of the form:</p>
<p class="code">&lt;form action=&quot;/credentials&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>Serve a form that would allow the user to enter a userid and password. (Using the styling from the previous question it might look like the following.)</p>
<p><img src="images/problem5-1.png" width="410" height="219" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter a name an password and press the submit button. Notice a GET request is sent to the server and that the form data is in the URL's query string portion and is in the URL address field of the browser.</p>
<p><img src="images/problem5-2.png" width="620" height="54" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/problem5-3.png" width="567" height="192" alt=""/></p>
<p>Notice also the ERROR: PAGE NOT FOUND response is sent back to the client by our server.</p>
<p>You should also modify the server's launch output so the console includes the <span class="code">/login.html</span> suggestion when the server launches. We will be asking you to include these prompts in all your course assignments.</p>
<p><img src="images/problem5-4.png" width="609" height="160" alt=""/></p>
<p class="segment-header">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="segment-header">Problem 6)</p>
<p>Modify the &quot;action&quot; attribute of the form by also including the <span class="code">method</span> attribute:</p>
<p class="code">&lt;form action=&quot;/credentials&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>Restart your server and again visit the <span class="code">http://localhost:3000/login.html</span> URL</p>
<p>This time when you enter the userid and password information and click submit you will notice the POST route in our server runs for the first time (which would have access to the login data via the <span class="code">request</span> object) and that the user data is NOT in the URL shown in the browser. (It is, in fact, in the body of the HTTP post message.)</p>
<p><img src="images/problem6-1.png" width="559" height="76" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/problem6-2.png" width="487" height="160" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice our server sends back a &quot;Thanks for your request&quot; page back to the client when it handles the client POST request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="red">When you have completed these problems demonstrate your code to a TA's to get credit for the tutorial.</span> </p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="segment-header">Optional Work)</p>
<p>If you solve the optional problems and like your solutions email them to me and I will post them for others to enjoy.</p>
<p>Here are some optional problems</p>
<p>1)If the client visits <span class="code">http://localhost:3000/index.html?name=Louis</span> we want the server to respond with &quot;Hello Louis&quot; instead of &quot;Hello World&quot;. Obviously we want it to work with any name -including yours.</p>
<p>So we want to extract the portion of the URL string after <span class="code">?name=</span> and use that to replace &quot;World&quot;. To keep things simple lets just make it to work if the URL string ends with <span class="code">?name=aName</span>. We will just do some javascript substring operations to extract the name. For example</p>
<p>replace code in the server like:</p>
<pre>
response.write(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
</pre>
<p>with something like the following instead:</p>
<pre>
let urlString= request.url
let index = urlString.indexOf("?name=")
if(index &gt; 0){
   let name = urlString.substring(index + "?name=".length, urlString.length)
   response.write("Hello " + name)
}
else 
  response.write(&quot;Hello World&quot;)

</pre>
<p>2) Our proposed solution to the previous problem would work for visiting <span class="code">http://localhost:3000/index.html?name=Louis</span> but would not work if the client visits URL's like:</p>
<p><span class="code">http://localhost:3000/index.html?name=Louis&amp;email=ldnel.com</span></p>
<p>Can you make it work more generally. That is, extract the <span class="code">?name=</span> portion from a more complex URL query string.</p>
<p>3) Can you modify the server code to not just say &quot;Thanks for your request&quot; when the user provides login credentials but rather say &quot;Thanks user: ldnel for your request&quot;. That is, thanks the user by the user id they supplied.</p>
