Question 1
-----------------

 - Because inode numbers are allocated by the system, you can not just change the inode number yourself. The only way to have a file with the same name as before with a different inode number would be to copy the file using the mv command (must name it something different or copy it to a different location), then remove the original file using the rm command, and finally rename the copied file to the same name as the original file.

	- The mv command will move either a file or directory to a new location, for example:
    			
		mv source_file destination

	- If the mv command is given a source file and a new filename it will copy the source file in the same directory and create a new identical file with the new filename.

	- The rm command will remove the given file from the directory.

 - To set up a key-based login using ssh, you must create a public and private rsa key on the host system, and then create an authorized_keys file on the remote system in /ssh and copy the public key you created the host system to this file.
